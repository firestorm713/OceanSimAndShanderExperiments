Ocean Surface Simulation and Shader Experiments
================================
This is a project by Andrew Quesenberry for Colorado Mesa University's Computer Graphics Course.

Its primary Purpose is to simulate an ocean surface based on statistical wave models, using the method described in Jerry Tessendorf's "Simulating Ocean Waves" whitepaper.

Current Status: Animated plane with animated textures, Procedurally generate Normal map, Tangents, and UVs.

Scene is held in Scenes/plane.unity
Script for ocean is currently Scripts/Plane.cs
Multiple plugins were used to handle FFT, Complex Numbers, and Matrices.
